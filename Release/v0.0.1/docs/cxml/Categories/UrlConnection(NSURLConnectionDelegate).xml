        <details>
            <para>The main purpose is to break the code base for <ref id="../Classes/UrlConnection$EXTENSION">UrlConnection</ref>
                 up into managable units. In this case we have a collection of delegate methods from NSURLConnection which handle the responses from a url.</para>
            <para>There is not a lot of code here. Most of it is around two things: connection:didReceiveData: which is used to assemble the text contained within an xml tag. And connection:canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace: which handles certificates and ssl security. </para>
