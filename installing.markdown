# Installing into XCode

As is becoming the standard, from version 0.1.4 of dXml, it is packaged as multi-platform static library. This means that the static library contains two versions of the code, one compiled for the simulator and one compiled for the device. Don't worry about selecting the right one, xcode will automatically include the correct code for you application.

Once you have downloaded the dmg download package, simply drag the framework directory to xcode. Thats all that is required.
