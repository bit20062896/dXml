# Downloading

You have a variety of choices in obtaining dXml. Firstly you can use the Download Static Library link on the side menu to access a dmg file containing everything you need to use dXml.

But if you want to compile or look at the source code you can use these two  links

[![zip](http://github.com/images/modules/download/zip.png)](http://github.com/drekka/dXml/zipball/master)
or
[![tar](http://github.com/images/modules/download/tar.png)](http://github.com/drekka/dXml/tarball/master)

Finally you can also clone the project with [git](http://git-scm.com) by running:

<pre class="console">$ git clone git://github.com/drekka/dXml</pre>
