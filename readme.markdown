# dXml readme

dXml was conceived when I was starting with ObjC and iPhone development. Seeing a number of people on the web looking for a DOM style parser and being interested in testing soap web services for a project, I decided to write a static library which contained the following features:

* A parser to convert a stream of xml into an object model.
* The ability to interact with web sites and handle the basic setup and communication.
* The ability to talk to soap based web services, constructing and deconstructing messages as necessary.
